## [Unreleased]

## [0.6.0] - 2023-10-22

### Added

- Support for Python 3.12
- Support for Gotify 2.4.0

## [0.5.0] - 2022-06-07

### Added

- Optional asynchronous gotify client `AsyncGotify` that works similar to the synchronous one
- Both `Gotify` and `AsyncGotify` can be used as a (asynchronous) context manager to reuse the HTTP session

### Changed

- Move test server setup from noxfile to a pytest fixture.
- Use [`httpx`](https://www.python-httpx.org/) instead of `requests`

### Removed

- Removed transitional support for `gotify.gotify` and module-level functions. To use the (synchronous) interface it is now **required** to use the `Gotify` class

## [0.4] - 2022-03-15

### Added

- Provide type hints for all methods
  - All json responses are type hinted using nontotal TypedDicts
- Use [black](https://github.com/psf/black),
  [isort](https://github.com/PyCQA/isort),
  [flakeheaven](https://github.com/flakeheaven/flakeheaven),
  [flake8-annotations](https://github.com/sco1/flake8-annotations),
  [flake8-docstrings](https://github.com/PyCQA/flake8-docstrings) and
  [mypy](https://github.com/python/mypy) to enforce code style and quality
- Add tests using [nox](https://github.com/theacodes/nox), [pytest](https://github.com/pytest-dev/pytest) and [trycast](https://github.com/davidfstr/trycast)
  - `nox -s test` downloads a server binary and starts a preconfigured test server on port 30080
  - tests for plugin-related API endpoints are still missing

### Changed

- Renamed `gotify.gotify` to `gotify.Gotify` for conformity with naming conventions and to reduce ambiguity
- Use a nested structure
- Deprecated names are available via `__getattr__()`
